These values are required for some conversion operations:
</div>

<ul class="arrowed-list">
    <li class="padded-li"><span>LilyPond location: Required for converting to or from a LilyPond file.</span></li>

    <li class="padded-li"><span>PDF Reader location: Required for opening the PDF file upon completion of a conversion to a PDF file.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="content">
If these locations are not set, then, respectively, the LilyPond conversion options are not available in the tool, and the "Open PDF file on completion" option for PDF conversion are not shown.
</div>
