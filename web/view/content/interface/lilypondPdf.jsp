</div>

<div class="content">
Select the "choose location" links and navigate to the program's location, or enter the fully-specified location (file name including the folder/directory path) in the text box.
</div>

<div class="content">

<div class="content">
These values are required for some conversion operations:
</div>

<ul class="arrowed-list">
    <li class="padded-li"><span>LilyPond location: Required for converting to PDF.</span></li>

    <li class="padded-li"><span>PDF Reader location: Required for opening the PDF file upon completion of a conversion to PDF.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="content">
If these locations are not set, then, respectively, conversion to PDF is not available in the tool, and the "Open PDF file on completion" option for PDF conversion is not shown.
</div>
